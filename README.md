# Hi there!

This app is here to help you sort out how much each of your friends needs to pay after you get a bill in a restaurant.

Very simple:

1. Enter the total amount of the bill
2. Choose how much tip you would like to give (0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%)
3. Add how many friends will be paying
4. Click on the Calculate button and see how much each of you need to pay :)
5. The Recalculate button brings you back to the main screen

Enjoy!
